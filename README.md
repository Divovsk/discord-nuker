# discord-nuker
Basically, this bot consists of 5 main commands, kill (delete channels), spam (spam messages), spamchannels (spam channels), megaban (ban everyone that this bot has permissions to) and unlimitedroles (creates roles until stopped).
Be aware that this bot is vulnerable to Discord rate limiters and that it can stop midway, so do what you want as quickly as possible. 
You need to install discord.py to use this bot and need to edit it so you can put the Token on the last line of code (it's indicated with a block comment).
